Keeping Track of your Children
A class is a factory that creates objects using its initialize method. In this short exercise weâ€™ll see how we can use our knowledge of self to let a class keep track of these objects.

1. Keep a list of objects a class creates

Write a class that maintains a list of all the objects that it creates. Here are some tests to show how it should work.

require 'test/unit'

class TestChildTracker < Test::Unit::TestCase

  def test_children
    assert_equal  [], ChildTracker.children
    c1 = ChildTracker.new
    assert_equal [c1], ChildTracker.children
    c2 = ChildTracker.new
    assert_equal [c1, c2], ChildTracker.children
  end

end
Try it on your own first.
