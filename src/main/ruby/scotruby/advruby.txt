 - to_proc: collection.map(&:meth_name)

 - object
    - don't think classes, think object.. classes only a way to create objects
    - always go to class for intance methods
 - self
   2 cases when self is not self
    - specifying receiver
    - in module, class decalration

 - class
    - ruby doesn't have class methods
    - don't use @@var !!

 - instance vars are always looked up at runtime in self
 - methods are always looked up at runtime in self.class


 - current class -- where methods are defined into

 - alias _copies_ method definition
